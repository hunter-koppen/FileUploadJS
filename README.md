## File Upload JS Action

The **File Upload JS Action** is a JavaScript action designed to facilitate file uploads, offering you greater control over how you present a user interface for uploading files. For instance, it can be used to enable users to directly upload a new profile picture with a simple click on the image instead of needing a separate upload page.

## Features

-   Upload an image or file via a Nanoflow.
-   Customize supported file types based on mimetype.

## Usage

1. Import the module into your project.
2. Create a button in your app that triggers a Nanoflow.
3. Add the JavaScript action to the button.
4. Configure the JavaScript action by providing an object that generalizes the FileDocument or Image entity.
